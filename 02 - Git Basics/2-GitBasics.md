## The README File

The README file serves as the first point of contact for users and developers who want to understand the purpose, setup, and usage of a project.

In a GitHub Repo, the README.md file is displayed on the main page of the repo. 

The .md at the end of the README.md stands for "markdown" which is a very simple and easy formatting language that we will use throughout this course. 


Programmers can use the README file to:
- Introduce their project
- Show screenshots of their program
- Explain how viewers can run the code for themselves
- List what technologies they used 
- Explain how other programmers can contribute to their project
- Contact Details
- and so much more!

### For Example: The Grab A Byte README
