# Lesson 3.1: Collaboration Basics I

Welcome to the Grab a Byte Lunchtime Learning Series! This semester we are learning GitHub!

Last week we learned basic Git commands ```status```, ```add```, ```commit```, and ```push``` as well as best practices for commit messages and some example workflows. 

This week we are going to go over some Collaboration Basics

## What Collaboration?
Just like collaboration on a group project (is supposed to be) in the real world, you can collaborate with a group on a project in GitHub. 

This means that multiple people can work on teh same codebase in the same repo at once! 

Members working on the same repo can avoid overwriting each others work by using branches and pull requests.

## Branches
**Branches** are separate versions of a project, allowing developers to work on different features or bug fixes without affecting the main, stable code. 

Each repository has a default branch (the default is main, but older repos might have a default called master, which we well cover below).

Think of branches like "drafts" of your project, or "development environments" where your main branch is your "production environment". Making edits to your branch does not effect other branches, until you merge them (which we will talk about later).


### main vs master
Before October 2020, the default branch was named "master" but in late 2020, GitHub wanted to start using more inclusive language so they changed the default name from master to main. 

If you ever need to rename your default branch, use the commands:
```
git branch -m master main
git push -u origin main
```
