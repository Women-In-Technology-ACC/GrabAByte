 These files are the workbook for the Fall 2025 Grab a Byte workshops!

 The Grab A Byte Workshop is an ongoing learning series for Austin Community College's Women Information Technology (WIT) group. 
 
 During our first semester (Spring 2025) we covered 15 Algorithms ranging from Linear and Binary Search to Depth-First and Breadth-First Search and Kruskal's and Prims Algorithm. You can find all the presentations and sample code in the "Past Workshops" folder. 

 These workshops are student taught and student lead. It is a great opportunity for public speaking, giving presentations, leadership, team work, and learn valuable topics in tech.
